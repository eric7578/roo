### Right now for Github, maybe tomorrow for Gitlab

#### For Developers
* Use `yarn install` to install dependencies
* Use `yarn watch` to start monitoring code changes and build scripts
* Visit `chrome://extensions` in google chrome browser, turn on `Develoer Mode`
* Hit `Load unpacked`, and target the `build` folder
* Visit any page in `github.com`, and the plugin is supposed to be right there!
